# README

This repo contains a quick demo exploring the data available in People Data Lab's companies dataset. The jupyter notebook as well as a [rendered html version](https://laughing-goldstine-368323.netlify.app/demo) are provided. 

Note that due to the size of the dataset, rendering and interactivity can be slow and currently none of the visualizations have been optimized to improve this. A minified demo notebook (and [render](https://laughing-goldstine-368323.netlify.app/demo-mini)) have been included that just use a subset of the original dataset.
